We study the Internet as a global critical infrastructure -- the thing the world depends on but barely understands.
Our work blends large-scale measurement, distributed systems, and real-world experimentation to uncover how today’s Internet actually operates: the hidden dependencies, opaque routing behavior, and fragile links that shape global connectivity.

We build systems, run measurements in the wild, and map the paths the Internet would prefer to keep out of sight -- from submarine cables and transit ASes to DNS resolvers, cloud platforms, and CDNs.
