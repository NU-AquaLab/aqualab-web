<p>Fabián Bustamante, a professor at Northwestern University’s McCormick School of Engineering, studies the interaction between flights and Internet connection, and his team of researchers recently developed an app called&nbsp;<a href="http://wifly.aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WiFly</a>. Passengers put their flight number in the app once they’ve purchased inflight&nbsp;WiFi, and the app will show connectivity&nbsp;speed across the duration of the trip, plus contribute data to research that could improve the speed of WiFi&nbsp;on planes.</p>
