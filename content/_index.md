# AquaLab

AquaLab is a research group in the Department of Computer Science at Northwestern University.  
We study **Internet-scale systems** and the **critical infrastructure** that keeps the world online.

Our work sits at the intersection of:

- Internet measurement and observability  
- Submarine cable networks and global connectivity  
- Cloud and CDN path transparency  
- DNS and routing infrastructure  
- Network resilience, survivability, and criticality  
- Distributed systems deployed “in the wild”  

We take an experimental approach: we build systems, run large-scale measurements, and use the resulting data to understand how the Internet actually behaves – and how it fails.

## Research Themes

- **Internet measurement & visibility**  
  Characterizing paths, dependencies, and hidden infrastructure (cloud networks, CDNs, DNS, IXPs, submarine cables).

- **Critical infrastructure & resilience**  
  Understanding how natural disasters, political events, and operational incidents impact global connectivity.

- **Cloud and CDN paths**  
  Making opaque routing and replica-selection decisions more transparent and accountable.

- **Distributed systems at scale**  
  Designing and evaluating systems in real-world conditions, not just simulations.
