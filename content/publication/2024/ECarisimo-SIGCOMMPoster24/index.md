We investigate network peering location choices, focusing on whether networks opt for distant peering sites even when nearby options are available. We conduct a network-wide cloud-based traceroute campaign using virtual machine instances from four major cloud providers to identify peering locations and calculate the "peering stretch": the extra distance networks travel beyond the nearest data center to their actual peering points. Our results reveal a median peering stretch of 300 kilometers, with some networks traveling as much as 6,700 kilometers. We explore the characteristics of networks that prefer distant peering points and the potential motivations behind these choices, providing insights into digital sovereignty and cybersecurity implications.
