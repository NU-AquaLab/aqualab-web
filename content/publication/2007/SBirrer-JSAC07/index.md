Overlay-based multicast has been proposed as a key alternative for large-scale group communication. There is ample motivation for such an approach, as it delivers the scalability advantages of multicast while avoiding the deployment issues of a network-level solution. As multicast functionality is pushed to autonomous, unpredictable end systems, however, signiﬁcant performance loss can result from their higher degree of transiency when compared to routers. Consequently, a number of techniques have recently been proposed to improve overlays’ resilience by exploiting path diversity and minimizing node dependencies. Delivering high application performance at relatively low costs and under high degree of transiency has proven to be a difﬁcult task. Each of the proposed resilient techniques comes with a different trade-off in terms of delivery ratio, end-to-end latency and additional network trafﬁc. In this paper, we review some of these approaches and evaluate their effectiveness by contrasting the performance and associated cost of representative protocols through simulation and wide area experimentation.

With an overlay-based approach, all multicast-related functionality is implemented at the end systems instead of at the routers. The participating hosts conﬁgure themselves in an overlay topology, with each edge in the overlay corresponding to a unicast path between two end systems in the underlying Internet. The goal of a multicast protocol is thus to construct and maintain an efﬁcient overlay for data transmission. As multicast functionality is pushed to autonomous, unpredictable end systems, however, signiﬁcant performance loss can result from their Manuscript received March 2, 2007; revised August 30, 2007.
