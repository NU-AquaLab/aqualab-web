We present a novel approach to remote traﬃc aggregation for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) called Cooperative Selective Wormholing (CSW). Our approach works by selectively aggregating traﬃc bound for unused network ports on a volunteer’s commodity PC.CSW could enable NIDS operators to cheaply and eﬃciently monitor large distributed portions of the Internet, something they are currently incapable of. Based on a study of several hundred hosts in a universitynetwork, we posit that there is suﬃcient heterogeneity in hosts’ networkservice conﬁgurations to achieve a high degree of network coverage by re-using unused port space on client machines. We demonstrate Vortex ,a proof-of-concept CSW implementation that runs on a wide range of com-modity PCs (Unix and Windows). Our experiments show that Vortex can selectively aggregate traﬃc to a virtual machine backend, eﬀectively allowing two machines to share the same IP address transparently. Weclose with a discussion of the basic requirements for a large-scale CSW deployment.
