The emergence of large cloud providers in the last decade has transformed the Internet, resulting in a seemingly ever-growing set of datacenters, points of presence, and network
peers. Despite the availability of closer peering locations, some networks continue to peer with cloud providers at distant locations, traveling thousands of kilometers. In this paper, we
employ a novel cloud-based traceroute campaign to characterize the distances networks travel to peer with the cloud. This unique approach allows us to gain unprecedented insights into the
peering patterns of networks. Our findings reveal that 50% of the networks peer within 300 kilometers of the nearest datacenter. However, our analysis also reveals that over 20% of networks travel at least 6,700 kilometers beyond the proximity of the nearest computing facility, and some as much as 18,791 kilometers! While these networks connect with the cloud worldwide, from South America to Europe and Asia, many come to peer with cloud providers in North America, even from Oceania and Asia. We explore possible motivations for the persistence of distant peering, discussing factors such as cost-effective routes, enhanced peering opportunities, and access to exclusive content.
