In just a few decades, the Internet has evolved from a research prototype to a cyber-physical infrastructure of critical importance for modern society and the global economy. Surprisingly, despite its new role, the survivability of the Internet—its ability to fulfill its mission in the presence of large-scale failures—has received limited attention. We introduce Domino, our initial design and implementation of a testbench tool for stress testing the Internet’s routing system, a key element of the critical Internet infrastructure. The simulation-based testbench consists of a comprehensive and flexible framework that allows for the incorporation of diverse survivability metrics, provides a platform for specifying, evaluating, and comparing different topologies of the underlying Internet infrastructure, and can account for modifications to networking protocols and architectural components. By demonstrating the utility of the proposed testbench with a number of illustrative examples, we make a case for stress testing as a viable approach to evaluating the Internet’s survivability in the face of evolving challenges.
