The Internet’s connectivity relies on a fragile submarine cable network (SCN),
yet existing tools fall short in assessing its criticality. We introduce
**Calypso**, a new framework that leverages traceroute data to map traffic to
submarine cables. Validated through real-world case studies, Calypso reveals
hidden risks and offers new insights for enhancing SCN resilience.
