One of the most im portant cha lleng es of peer -to-peer m ulticast pro tocols is the ability to efficiently d eal with the high degree of churn inherent to their environm ent. As m ulticast functionality is pushed to autonom ous, unpredictable peers, significant perfor mance losses can result from group m embership cha nges and the higher failure rates of end- hosts when com pared to routers. Achieving high delivery ratios w ithout sacrificing end- to-end laten cies or incu rring add itional co sts has proven to b e a challenging task. This paper introduces N emo, a nove l peer-to -peer m ulticast p rotoco l that aim s at achiev ing th is elus ive go al. W e present an extensive com parative evaluation of our protocol through sim ulation and wide-a rea experim entation. We com pare the perform ance of Ne mo with that of three alternative protoc ols: Narada, Nice and Nice- PRM. Our results show how Ne mo can achie ve delivery ratios sim ilar to those of comparable protocols (up to 99.98%) under differe nt failure rates, bu t at a fraction of their cost in term s of duplic ate pack ets (reduction s > 85%) an d control-related traffic. Keywords: Peer-to-peer, overlay multicast, resilience, churn.
