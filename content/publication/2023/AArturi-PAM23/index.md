An organization-level topology of the Internet is a valuable resource with uses that range from the study of organizations’ footprints and Internet centralization trends, to analysis of the dynamics of the Internet’s corporate structures as result of (de)mergers and acquisitions. Current approaches to infer this topology rely exclusively on WHOIS databases and are thus impacted by its limitations, including errors and outdated data. We argue that a collaborative, operator-oriented database such as PeeringDB can bring a complementary perspective from the legally-bounded information available in WHOIS records. We present 
 , a new framework that leverages self-reported information available on PeeringDB to boost the state-of-the-art WHOIS-based methodologies. We discuss the challenges and opportunities with using PeeringDB records for AS-to-organization mappings, present the design of 
 and demonstrate its value identifying companies operating in multiple continents and mergers and acquisitions over a five-year period.
