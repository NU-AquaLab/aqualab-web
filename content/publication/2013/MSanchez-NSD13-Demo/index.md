{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
Dasu is an extensible platform for running network measurements and experiments at the Internet’s edge. Its clients run on end hosts, have built-in support for broadband characterization—an incentive for end-user adoption—and execute third-party experiment tasks. The platform supports concurrent third-party experiments by delegating clients to tasks based on experiment speciﬁcations and resource availability. This demo focuses on Dasu’s task delegation mechanism and shows how it enables third-party experimentation and maintain security and accountability.
