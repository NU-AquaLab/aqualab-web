An accurate Internet topology graph is important in many are as of networking,fromdecidingISPbusinessrelationshipstodi agnosing networkanomalies. MostInternetmappingeffortshavederi vedthe network structure, at the level of interconnected autonomo us systems (ASes), from a limited number of either BGP- or tracerou tebased data sources. While techniques for charting the topol ogy continue toimprove, the growth ofthe number of vantage poin ts is signiﬁcantlyoutpaced bythe rapidgrowth of the Internet. In this paper, we argue that a promising approach to revealin g thehiddenareasoftheInternettopologyisthroughactivem easurementfromanobservation platformthatscaleswiththegrowi ngInternet. By leveraging measurements performed by an extensi on to a popular P2P system, we show that this approach indeed expos es signiﬁcant new topological information.
