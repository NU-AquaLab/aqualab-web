The global airline industry conducted over 33 million ights in 2014 alone, carrying over 3.3 billion passengers. Surprisingly, the trac management system handling this ight volume communicates over either VHF audio transmissions or plane transponders, exhibiting several seconds of latency and single bits per second of throughput. There is a general consensus that for the airline industry to serve the growing demand will require of signi cant improvements to the air trac management system; we believe that many of these improvements can leverage the past two decades of mobile networking research. In this paper, we make the case that moving to a common IP-based data channel to support ight communication can radically change the airline industry. While there remain many challenges to achieve this vision, we believe that such a shift can greatly improve the rate of innovation, overall eciency of global air trac management, enhance aircraft safety and create new applications that leverage the capability of an advanced data channel. Through preliminary measurements on existing in- ight Internet communication systems, we show that existing in- ight connectivity achieves order of magnitude higher throughput and lower latency than current systems, and operates as a highly reliable and available data link. This position paper takes a rst look at the opportunity for IP-based ight communication, and identi es several promising research areas in this space. 1. INTRODUCTION The global airline industry is experiencing exceptional growth. In 2014 alone, it supported 33 million ights carrying over 3.3 billion passengers [10], and these numbers are expected to grow steadily over the next 20 years at a 2.5% annual rate [8]. At the same time, the system is already exhibiting a high degree of fragility [1] with over 22% of all ights delayed and 2.6% of ights cancelled during the same period [21].
