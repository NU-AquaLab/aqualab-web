The global airline industry conducted over 33 million ights in 2014 alone, carrying over 3.3 billion passengers. Surprisingly, the trac management system handling this ight volume communicates over either VHF audio transmissions or plane transponders, exhibiting several seconds of latency and single bits per second of throughput. There is a general consensus that for the airline industry to serve the growing demand will require of signi cant improvements to the air trac management system; we believe that many of these improvements can leverage the past two decades of mobile networking research. 

In this paper, we make the case that moving to a common IP-based data channel to support ight communication can radically change the airline industry. While there remain many challenges to achieve this vision, we believe that such a shift can greatly improve the rate of innovation, overall eciency of global air trac management, enhance aircraft safety and create new applications that leverage the capability of an advanced data channel. Through preliminary measurements on existing in-flight Internet communication systems, we show that existing in-flight connectivity achieves order of magnitude higher throughput and lower latency than current systems, and operates as a highly reliable and available data link. This position paper takes a first look at the opportunity for IP-based flight communication, and identifies several promising research areas in this space.
