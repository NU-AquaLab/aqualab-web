A social news site presents user-curated content, ranked by popularity. Popular curators like Reddit, or Facebook have become e ective way of crowdsourcing news or sharing for personal opinions. Traditionally, these services require a centralized authority to aggregate data and determine what to display. However, the trust issues that arise from a centralized system are particularly damaging to the \Web democracy" that social news sites are meant to provide. 

In this poster, we present cliq, a decentralized social news curator. cliq is a P2P based social news curator that provides private and unbiased reporting. All users in cliq share responsibility for tracking and providing popular content. Any user data that cliq needs to store is also managed across the network. We rst inform our design of cliq through an analysis of Reddit. We design a way to provide content curation without a persistent moderator, or usernames.
