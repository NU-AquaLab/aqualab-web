In this poster, we posit that in the developed world broadband reliability will soon become the dominant feature for service comparison. We use data collected from residential gateways (via FCC/SamKnows) and end-hosts (via Namehelp) to study the availability and reliability of fixed-line broadband networks. Using natural experiments, we look at the impact that increased network downtime has on user demand.
