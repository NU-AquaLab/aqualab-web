We are becoming increasingly aware that the effectiveness of mobile crowdsourcing systems critically depends on the whims of their human participants, impacting everything from participant engagement to their compliance with the crowdsourced tasks. In response, a number of such systems have started to incorporate different incentive features aimed at a wide range of goals that span from improving participation levels, to extending the systems’ coverage, and enhancing the quality of the collected data. Despite the many related efforts, the inclusion of incentives in crowdsourced systems has so far been mostly ad-hoc, treating incentives as a wild-card response ﬁtted for any occasion and goal. Using data from a large, 2-day experiment with 96 participants at a corporate conference, we present an analysis of the impact of two incentive structures on the recruitment, compliance and user effort of a basic mobile crowdsourced service. We build on these preliminary results to argue for a principled approach for selecting incentive and incentive structures to match the variety of requirements of mobile crowdsourcing applications and discuss key issues in working toward that goal. 1. INTRODUCTION Mobile crowdsourcing leverage the pervasiveness of smartphones and other resource-rich devices to create a wide range of services from community sensing [7, 17, 20], to wireless network characterization [9, 10] and micro-task markets [5, 24]. Despite the rich potential of mobile crowdsourcing services, we are increasingly aware that their effectiveness critically depends on the whims of their participants, impacting everything from user engagement to their compliance with the crowdsourced tasks. In response, a number of such systems have started to incorporate different incentive features including various forms of rewards, such as monetary, social and gaming-related, and incentive structures (e.g., lottery, per-time or per-task payments [15, 25]). Not surprisingly, the moti
