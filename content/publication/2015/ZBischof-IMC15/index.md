The goal of our work is to characterize the current state of Cuba's access to the wider Internet. This work is motivated by recent improvements in connectivity to the island and the growing commercial interest following the ease of restrictions on travel and trade with the US. In this paper, we pro le Cuba's networks, their connections to the rest of the world, and the routes of international trac going to and from the island. Despite the addition of the ALBA-1 submarine cable, we nd that round trip times to websites hosted o the island remain very high; pings to popular websites frequently took over 300 ms. We also nd a high degree of path asymmetry in trac to/from Cuba. Speci cally, in our analysis we nd that trac going out of Cuba typically travels through the ALBA-1 cable, but, surprisingly, trac on the reverse path often traverses high-latency satellite links, adding over 200 ms to round trip times. Last, we analyze queries to public DNS servers and SSL certi cate requests to characterize the availability of network services in Cuba.
