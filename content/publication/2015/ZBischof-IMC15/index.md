The goal of our work is to characterize the current state of Cuba’s access to the wider Internet. This work is motivated by recent improvements in connectivity to the island and the
growing commercial interest following the ease of restrictions on travel and trade with the US. In this paper, we profile Cuba’s networks, their connections to the rest of the world,
and the routes of international traﬃc going to and from the island. Despite the addition of the ALBA-1 submarine cable, we find that round trip times to websites hosted oﬀ the island remain very high; pings to popular websites frequently took over 300 ms. We also find a high degree
of path asymmetry in traﬃc to/from Cuba. Specifically, in our analysis we find that traﬃc going out of Cuba typically travels through the ALBA-1 cable, but, surprisingly, traﬃc
on the reverse path often traverses high-latency satellite links, adding over 200 ms to round trip times. Last, we analyze queries to public DNS servers and SSL certificate requests to characterize the availability of network services in Cuba.
