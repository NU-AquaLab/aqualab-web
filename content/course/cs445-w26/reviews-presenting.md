This course is a **seminar**, which means:

- You read the papers before class  
- You contribute to discussion  
- You review papers  
- You present a paper

Here is what that entails.

## Reading & Pre-Class Questions

Each week includes several required papers labeled:

- **{{< reading_tag "background" >}}** — foundational context  
- **{{< reading_tag "question" >}}** — requires answering a pre-class question  
- **{{< reading_tag "review" >}}** — requires deeper reading and critique  

Before each class, you must answer a short question on Canvas for every  
**{{< reading_tag "question" >}}** or **{{< reading_tag "review" >}}** paper *for which you are not the assigned presenter or reviewer*.

These are graded for comprehension — short but thoughtful answers are enough.

## Writing Reviews — WINE 2026 Mini-Conference

The class runs a small program-committee–style process using:

**WINE (We do INternet Experimentation) 2026**
[HotCRP](https://northwestern-ise26.hotcrp.com/)

You will:

- Write several **conference-style reviews**  
- Evaluate originality, significance, clarity, and methodology  
- Participate in a **PC meeting** to discuss and “accept/reject” papers  
- Lead discussion for at least one paper as a reviewer

Suggested reading for reviewing:

- M. Allman, *Thoughts on Reviewing*, SIGCOMM CCR 2008  
- T. Roscoe, *Writing Reviews for Systems Conferences*, 2007  

Reviews are expected to look like standard systems/IMC/NSDI/SIGCOMM reviews: a short summary, strengths/weaknesses, and a clear recommendation with justification.

## Presenting Papers

Every student will present at least **one paper**.  
Presentations are typically **15–20 minutes** plus discussion.

A good presentation demonstrates:

- Understanding of the problem  
- Clarity about the methodology  
- Awareness of limitations  
- Ability to explain why the paper matters  
- Critical insight beyond regurgitating the text  

### Helpful guides

- M. Ernst, *Advice on Giving Talks*  
- S. Peyton Jones et al., *How to Give a Great Research Talk*  

Slides should be posted to Canvas before class.

## Participation Expectations

You’re expected to:

- Engage with questions during discussion  
- Challenge assumptions  
- Offer alternative explanations  
- Connect papers across weeks  
- Bring your own research experiences into conversation  

What you get out of a seminar is strongly correlated with what you put in.
