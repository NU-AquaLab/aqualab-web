Welcome to **CS 445 — Internet-Scale Experimentation (Winter 2026)**.

This course explores the challenges of conducting experimentation and measurement in large-scale networked systems. We examine foundational techniques, modern Internet-wide datasets, and cutting-edge research published in 2025–2026. The class runs using a hybrid model:

- **Weeks 1–5:** Instructor-led lectures introducing platforms, methodologies, and core measurement challenges.  
- **Weeks 6–10:** Student-led presentations following a *mini-conference* format, with students serving as the program committee.

By the end of the course, you will have:

- Developed a practical understanding of Internet-scale measurement tools and platforms.  
- Analyzed real-world network behavior and infrastructures.  
- Served as a reviewer in a PC-style meeting to select “accepted” papers.  
- Completed two hands-on projects involving measurement, analysis, and reproducibility.
