The project component includes two hands-on assignments:  
a **warm-up project** to develop essential skills, and a **reproducibility project** to deepen your understanding through practice.  
Below is a concise overview. Full details live on Canvas.

## Warm-Up Project

The warm-up project gives you practical experience with Internet-scale measurement techniques, focusing on analyzing **cross-border dependencies in government hosting**.

**Deliverables**
- **Report**: 3–5 pages describing your methodology, findings, and analysis.  
- **Presentation**: A concise 5-minute presentation summarizing your work.

---

## Reproducibility Project

For the second assignment, you will work in small teams to **reproduce results from a published research paper**.  
This is designed to help you deeply understand a significant networking paper and its methodology.

You will:
- Choose a paper (from the course list or propose your own).  
- Identify the specific component you intend to reproduce.  
- Outline your approach and scope.  
- **Contact the original authors** (strongly encouraged!).  
- Meet at least once with course staff for a mid-quarter check-in.

---

### Final Deliverables

1. **Presentation**: A short talk summarizing the paper and what you reproduced.  
2. **Report**:  
   - 6 pages max, using the **HotNets format**.  
   - Appendices/webpage allowed for additional details.

## Suggested Report Structure

- **Abstract** – What you did, why it matters, and your top-line results.  
- **Problem Statement** – What problem were you addressing?  
- **Prior Work** – What has been done, and why wasn’t it enough?  
- **Research Approach** – What you built or analyzed; how you approached replication.  
- **Results** – Evaluation, insights, unexpected findings.  
- **Lessons Learned + Future Work** – What you’d change or extend.  
- **Summary + Conclusion** – Wrap-up and implications.
