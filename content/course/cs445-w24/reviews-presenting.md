Here is what that entails.

## Reading & Pre-Class Questions

Each week includes several **required papers** labeled:

- **[Background]** — foundational context  
- **[Question]** — requires answering a pre-class question  
- **[Review]** — requires deeper reading & critique  

Before each class, you must answer a short question on Canvas for every **[Question]** or **[Review]** paper *for which you are not the assigned presenter or reviewer*.

These are graded for comprehension — short but thoughtful answers are sufficient.

## Writing Reviews (WINE 2024 Mini-Conference)

The class runs a small program-committee–style process using:

**WINE (We do Internet Experimentation) 2024**  
HotCRP (link will be posted)

You will:

- Write **4–6 reviews**  
- Evaluate originality, significance, clarity, and methodology  
- Participate in a **PC meeting** to discuss and “accept/reject” papers  
- Lead discussion for one paper as a reviewer

Your reviews should follow standard conference expectations:

**Suggested reading**  
- M. Allman, *Thoughts on Reviewing*, SIGCOMM CCR 2008  
- T. Roscoe, *Writing Reviews for Systems Conferences*, 2007

## Presenting Papers

Every student will present at least **one paper**.  
Presentations are typically **15–20 minutes** plus discussion.

A good presentation demonstrates:

- Understanding of the problem  
- Clarity about the methodology  
- Awareness of limitations  
- Ability to explain why the paper matters  
- Critical insight beyond regurgitating the text  

### Helpful guides

- M. Ernst, *Advice on Giving Talks*  
- S. Peyton Jones et al., *How to Give a Great Research Talk*  
- Microsoft Academic: *Give Great Research Talks*

Slides should be posted to Canvas before class.

## Participation Expectations

You’re expected to:

- Engage with questions during discussion  
- Challenge assumptions  
- Offer alternative explanations  
- Connect papers across weeks  
- Bring your own research experiences into conversation
  
What you get out of school depends on what you put on it; this is speacialy true of seminars.
