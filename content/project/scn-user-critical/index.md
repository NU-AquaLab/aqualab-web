## Abstract

Submarine cables form the backbone of the global Internet, yet their criticality is often assessed purely through infrastructure-centric models. Our paper, **"Out of Sight, Not Out of Mind - A User-View on the Criticality of the Submarine Cable Network,"** shifts this focus to a **user-centric perspective**.

The project aims to provide a quantitative measure of the **real-world impact** of Submarine Cable Network (SCN) faults on end-user connectivity. By analyzing data generated by users, we reveal the actual resilience and vulnerabilities of the global Internet in the face of cable failures.

The accompanying code and dataset allow researchers to replicate our analysis and explore:
* How often and where SCN faults occur.
* The extent of the **redundancy** and **failover mechanisms** implemented by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
* The true impact of cable cuts on latency, throughput, and reachability experienced by users around the globe.

## Project Details

The code and dataset are made publicly available to promote further research into the resilience of critical Internet infrastructure.
