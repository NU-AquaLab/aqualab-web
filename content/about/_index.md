We study the Internet as a global, critical infrastructure, one that billions of people depend on but which we still struggle to observe, understand, and secure. Our work spans large-scale networked systems, Internet measurement, and distributed systems, with an emphasis on problems that emerge when the Internet meets the real world: natural disasters, geopolitical conflict, consolidation, and increasingly opaque data-plane and control-plane behavior.

Our approach is unapologetically experimental. We design, deploy, and evaluate systems in the wild, using large measurement platforms, edge devices, and our own tools for observing how networks behave at scale. We are particularly interested in the hidden dependencies that shape global connectivity -— from submarine cable networks and transit ASes to DNS resolvers, CDNs, cloud providers, and service interconnections —- and in how these dependencies affect resilience, sovereignty, and user experience.

If you are interested in joining the group, please read this [page](https://forms.gle/UhMDKJRktyns9YBSA). We are always looking for PhD students who are excited about experimental systems, Internet-scale measurement, and making sense of the complex infrastructure that keeps the world online.
